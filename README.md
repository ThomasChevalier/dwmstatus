# dwmstatus
Fork of https://git.suckless.org/dwmstatus/

I don't use this status bar anymore. See [dwmbar](https://github.com/ThomasChevalier/dwmbar) for a better alternative. 

The function `get_volume` can be particularly useful as it returns the volume level on a linear scale, using the low level alsa library.  

# Usage
Add `dwmstatus 2>&1 >/dev/null &` to your xinit.rc
